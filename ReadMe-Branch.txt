1. Project Overview

The Simple Banking System is a basic console-based banking application designed to simulate fundamental banking operations.
It allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and manage their accounts securely.

This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and data handling, making it ideal for learning purposes.



2. Features

User registration

Secure login system

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Balance inquiry

Account data management

Exit and logout functionality



3. System Flow

Program starts

User chooses to register or login

System validates user credentials

Main menu appears

User selects an operation (deposit, withdraw, check balance, logout)

System processes the request

Program returns to main menu or exits



4. Technologies Used

Programming Language: (add your language here, e.g., Python / Java / C++)

Platform: Console / Terminal

Version Control: Git & GitHub



5. Flowchart Explanation

The flowchart explains:

How the program starts

Decision making for login or registration

Banking operations processing

Program termination

It visually represents the algorithm and logic used in the system.



6. Purpose of the Project

To understand how banking systems work

To practice programming logic

To demonstrate algorithm flow

To learn version control and documentation



7. Future Improvements

Add money transfer between users

Add loan system

Add transaction history

Add password encryption

Add graphical user interface
